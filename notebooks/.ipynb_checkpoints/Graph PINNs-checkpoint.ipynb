Specifically, we will see how PINNs allow us to blend non-invasive measurement techniques such 4D flow MRI with computational fluid dynamics models, towards providing a cheap and effective tool for characterizing velocity and pressure pulse wave propagation in human systemic arteries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Recent advances in clinical measurement and computational modeling techniques introduce new capabilities for monitoring the human cardiovascular system from different perspectives such as disease surveys \\cite{rose1982cardiovascular}, bio-medical image processing \\cite{kak2002principles,haris2014technique}, computational mathematics \\cite{formaggia2010cardiovascular, figueroa2006coupled, reymond2009validation,grinberg2011modeling}, bio-physics \\cite{stefanovska1999physics, ma2018relation}, etc. These studies reveal the crucial role played by blood flow, arterial wall mechanics and pressure wave propagation, and how their interplay directly characterizes the functionality of the cardiovascular system both in health and disease (e.g., hypertensive disorders \\cite{o1995mechanical}). \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the inner workings of the cardiovascular system has been central to many studies involving clinical, interventional or computational approaches. For instance, Chan {\\it et. al.} \\cite{chan2007hybrid} proposed placing sensors in the human body  to achieve real time measuring of arterial velocity and wall displacement to monitor the health of patients. Although the collected {\\it in-vivo} measurements can be highly accurate, such interventional techniques are sometimes expensive and suffer from limitations that are not easy to address, e.g., difficulties of placing probes in cerebral or uteroplacental arteries \\cite{kett2002adverse}. These limitations motivate the use of non-invasive measurement techniques such as bio-medical imaging, advances in which currently define the clinical standard of care \\cite{edelstein1980spin, antiga2008image, yushkevich2006user, SCI:Seg3D}. To this end, one of the most commonly used techniques is Doppler ultrasound velocimetry \\cite{aaslid1982noninvasive} that enables the recovery of blood velocity wave propagation. Using information related to the  pulsatility of the flow \\cite{mitchell2011arterial}, clinicians are able to infer quantitative information about the pressure in the arterial vessels, e.g., large pulsatility is caused by large pressure \\cite{ma2018relation}. Rather than Doppler ultrasound, more recent studies leverage advances in 4D flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \\cite{markl20124d} to recover the full three-dimensional velocity flow field. This method provides a more detailed representation of the flow, and also a larger spatial coverage that can capture quantities like vessel tortuosity in a more accurate manner. Moreover, structural characteristics like the cross-sectional area and vessel diameter can be recovered by segmenting 2D cine images \\cite{plein2001steady} from MRI measurements. However, critical variables such as the pressure cannot be directly measured by a non-invasive technique \\cite{barker1985non}, and accurate measurements are only accessible by inserting a catheter equipped with sensors inside the vessel of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Open challenges\n",
    "These difficulties of directly measuring quantities of interest like the pressure in an {\\it in-vivo} and non-invasive manner have motivated the use of computer simulations and computational fluid dynamics models to predict them {\\it in-silico}. Advances in algorithms and computing resources now allow us to perform detailed flow simulations in complex patient-specific arterial topologies using three-dimensional (3D) and/or one-dimensional (1D) formulations of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations \\cite{formaggia2010cardiovascular, figueroa2006coupled, reymond2009validation,grinberg2011modeling, urquiza2006multidimensional, sherwin2003one}. Such tools have been successfully validated against both {\\it in-vitro} experiments \\cite{matthys2007pulse} as well as {\\it in-vivo} clinical data \\cite{revie2013validation}, and provide a valuable platform for parametric sensitivity studies \\cite{chen2013simulation}. Despite their predictive power, computational models have still not made their way into clinical practice primarily due to their high computational cost and the tedious procedures needed for their practical deployment, e.g., mesh generation, parameter calibration, etc. For instance, such models require the precise subscription of boundary conditions that effectively capture the downstream flow dynamics in small arteries and arterioles via the use of Windkessel or structured tree models \\cite{westerhof2009,grinberg2008outflow,olufsen1999structured,perdikaris2015effective}. Inaccurate calibration of the parameters associated with these boundary conditions is often the cause of brittleness in the resulting predictions, thus limiting the translational impact of computational models to the clinical domain.\n",

    "### Modeling blood flow in arterial networks with PINNs\n",
    "In contrast to traditional computational fluid dynamics models, PINNs do not suffer from the cumbersome generation of computational meshes, nor they requires the precise prescription of boundary conditions. Instead, they can directly use noisy and scattered measurements obtained by medical imaging at points other than the boundaries to accurately predict the pressure and recover flow information. Furthermore, as flow conditions in general do not vary greatly from one patient to another, pre-trained neural network models can be rapidly adapted to a new patient case. After a PINN model is trained, all quantities of interest (blood velocity, wall displacement and pressure) can be predicted for every temporal or spatial point in the network. "

    "Pulse wave propagation in arterial networks can be effectively modeled using one-dimensional (1D) reduced order models \\cite{sherwin2003one, reymond2009validation, reymond2011validationPS}. In order to achieve the order reduction, a series of assumptions need to be made  \\cite{sherwin2003computational}. First, we assume that the local curvature is small enough such that the geometry can be described using a Cartesian coordinate $x$. Moreover, the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, since we are considering geometries consisting of large arteries, so the density and dynamic viscosity are constant. Lastly, the structural properties of the artery are preserved at a cross-section. Following \\cite{sherwin2003computational, formaggia2010cardiovascular} we consider a reduced form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Conservation of mass and momentum can be expressed as a hyperbolic conservation law \\cite{sherwin2003computational} that describes the evolution of blood velocity and cross-sectional area \\cite{sherwin2003one, formaggia2010cardiovascular}. In order to close the system, a third equation accounting for the relation between the pressure and the area is used, which is derived by assuming a thin wall tube and using Laplace's law \\cite{sherwin2003computational}. \n",

For overcoming this problem, we employ a  non-dimensionalization and normalization technique with the purpose of scaling the input and the output of the neural networks in a proper scale (e.g., $(\\hat{A}, \\hat{u}, \\hat{p}, x_*, t_*) \\in [0, 1]$) and normalizing the spatial and temporal coordinates to have zero mean and unit variance for training the neural networks more efficiently. For the purpose of non-dimensionalization we introduce the characteristic variables, which are commonly used in multi-scale physics \\cite{famiglietti1994multiscale} in order to simplify the equations.
